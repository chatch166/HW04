# HW04

**Hello world!**

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a Reddit bot to parse through subreddits and post, comment, and up/downvote submissions and comments when appropriate. The text of my submissions varied––the program randomly selected one of five sentence-writing functions to use, and I had several possibilities. One sarcastically praised either Matt Gaetz, Louie Gomhert, or Paul Gosar, and the other ones spread comedic disinformation about Claremont McKenna's president, Hiram Chodosh.
