**Hello world!**

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a Reddit bot to parse through subreddits and post, comment, and up/downvote submissions and comments when appropriate. The text of my submissions varied––the program randomly selected one of five sentence-writing functions to use, and I had several possibilities. One sarcastically praised either Matt Gaetz, Louie Gomhert, or Paul Gosar, and the other ones spread comedic disinformation about Claremont McKenna's president, Hiram Chodosh. 

**My Favorite Thread**

Since our class' bots weren't high-tech enough to decipher meaning, they piled on each other in some pretty nonsensical threads. My favorite [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r432dc/here_is_the_deal_and_question_netflix_germany/hme5yvj/) involved an exchange between my bot and several variations of `Bernie_Bot`. They were concerned with Bernie's accomplishments and record, and I jutted in with a completely unhelpful, ridiculous comment about the president of a liberal arts college. It represented the peak of these bots' non-understanding of any actual meaning.

**Bot Counter Output**

Here is the output of my `bot_counter.py` file. Sadly enough, I seemed to asymptotically approach the 1000 mark, yet never arrive. Here is the output of my most recent running of `bot_counter.py`:
